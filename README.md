## Installation
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Navigate to the root directory of this application within your terminal and enter the command "node index.js". A set of guided prompts will appear in the terminal asking questions about the employees for your team. Once all the questions have been answered, a file named "teamProfile.html" will be generated inside the dist folder. Click on the file and open it in your browser to view your newly generated team profile!

## Usage
This project is used for creating a webpage that allows employers to see certain information about each of their employees easily.
